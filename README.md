## Exercise
The company ACME offers their employees the flexibility to work the hours they want. But due to some external circumstances they need to know what employees have been at the office within the same time frame.

The goal of this exercise is to output a table containing pairs of employees and how often they have coincided in the office.

### Input
The name of an employee and the schedule they worked, indicating the time and hours. This should be a .txt file with at least five sets of data. You can include the data from our examples below:

Example 1:
_INPUT_
RENE=MO10:00-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH01:00-03:00,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00 ANDRES=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

_OUTPUT_
ASTRID-RENE: 2 
ASTRID-ANDRES: 3 
RENE-ANDRES: 2

Example 2:
_INPUT_
RENE=MO10:15-12:00,TU10:00-12:00,TH13:00-13:15,SA14:00-18:00,SU20:00-21:00 
ASTRID=MO10:00-12:00,TH12:00-14:00,SU20:00-21:00

_OUTPUT_
RENE-ASTRID: 3

## Overview
This exercise was solved as part of the Junior Software developer screening at Ioet. I used TypeScript for solving this challenge using a modular pattern and focused on TDD using Jest. 

The code also follows SOLID principles applied to Functional Programming like Single-Responsibility and interface segregation principles.
